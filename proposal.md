Problem Statement:

    As of Oct 2017, there is no reliable way to gather quantifiable information on the experience of a customer in a bank. Most of the information gathered today is through feedback forms, which provides only partial information to the bank.
    Due to the high volume of customers that are handled by a bank branch, it is not possible to provide a personal experience to the customer by an employee. As a result, the interaction with the bank leaves the customer with a mechanical experience. This is an area of improvement, and thus, and opportunity in disguise.

Project Deliverables and Beneficiaries:
By the end of the project, we aim to achieve the following:

    An Artificial intelligence based solution that can provide a unique identifier(hereafter referred to as Face-ID) based on facial structure, using camera feeds from CCTV cameras installed in the bank. This will be a scalable system which can be scaled as per the banks requirements. The FACE-ID will be stored as a alpha-numeric word containing 32 characters. The FACE-ID would be integrated with the existing records .
    A system to lookup the existing customer records using the FACE-ID thus fetching the required consumer data in real time.
    A system to quantify the emotions of a customer during his/her interaction with a bank official, which can then be mapped to a scale of 1-10.
    Identification of HNI individuals as soon as they enter a bank thus enabling the bank to provide quality services to such people.For instance if an HNI individual enters a bank a notification can be sent to the manager to take appropriate action.
    A web application to demonstrate the above mentioned functionalities from a live video stream.

Strategic Value:

    By quantifying the emotions of a customer during their interaction with the bank, and by further aggregating the data for a particular employee/branch, it is possible to generate accurate metrics on performance.
    By identifying a customer using their face, it is possible for an employee to know before hand the details of the customer, and thus makes it easier to provide a more personal service to the customer.
    Security alerts can be automatically generated for known / convicted criminal thus enhancing the safety of a bank.

Timeline:
October 15 :2017 -> Results of Stage 1
October 15-2017 -- 22 October --> Making a Face Recognition and Emotion Identification System using Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services.
October 22 -- 29 October --> Building a Web application by integrating the given the above work as well as making custom modification.
October 22 -- 5 November --> Fine tuning of the application . Adding some extra functionality etc.
